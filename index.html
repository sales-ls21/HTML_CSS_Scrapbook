								<h2>About Us</h2>
								<div class="container">
									<div class="row">
										<div class="col-md-12 paraDiv">
											<p>
											We are Jason and Molly Mellema from mid-Michigan. We were married in the summer of 2013, are in our 30s, and wanted to take a big trip prior to having kids (beyond our dog Kaya, of course). Europe was our pick.
											</p>
											<p>
											But how to choose which cities to see? Places to go? Things to do? We knew we wanted to see as much as possible so that we could determine where we would want to travel back to in the future, and the only requirement was that Venice had to be on the list (because according to Molly's grandma before she passed away, "You have to see Venice before it is completely under water"), so we decided a Rick Steves Tour was the way to go. Less hassle for us, and more enjoyment while traveling!	
											</p>
											<p>
											After reviewing the plethora of tour options, we determined the Europe My Way in 14 Day tour was our best bet. (I would have preferred the 21 Day tour but vacation days dictated this decision.)	
											</p>
											<p>
											We finally decided on the My Way option because we were more interested in seeing the architecture of the cities and being active outside as opposed to seeing the insides of museums. We wanted the autonomy to make these decisions on our own. However, the Rick Steves audio app came in handy on several occasions. Be sure to download it prior to your trip!
											</p>
											<p>
											Ultimately we are so thankful we decided on a Rick Steves Tour and can't believe the amazing experience we had!	Please join us in reliving our tour via this digital scrapbook. Click the links above to learn more about the cities we visited and the experiences we had. Those interested in taking a European vacation, be sure to look over our "Travel Tips" to maximize your experience and avoid some of the mistakes we made.

											<h3>Journal Highlights</h3>
											<h5>Saturday July 16, 2016</h5>
											<p>We landed at London Heathrow a little after 11am London time, took Heathrow Express into the city, caught a subway (tube) ride to our hotel, and off we went exploring.</p><p>Fortunately for us there was a fantastic Saturday market just outside our hotel’s entrance where we were able to delight in an English tradition of strawberries and cream—delicious—before walking about.</p><p>Our first stop was the Tower of London, mere steps from our hotel (which also had a fantastic view of Tower Bridge). We then proceeded to walk all over the city taking in sights such as St. Paul’s Basilica, Trafalgar Square, Buckingham Palace, Big Ben, and London Eye to name a few. We had fish and chips, along with a local beer, at Rock & Sole Plaice (a recommendation we found on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives) for dinner. And there no better way to end that kind of day and night than with a pint of Ben & Jerry's, a glass of wine, and the British Open on the teli.</p>
	
											<h5>Sunday July, 17, 2016</h5>
											<p>We woke up fairly early in London because we knew we had limited time left in the city, and still wanted to check out the British Museum. Which is where we started our day...</p><p>The British Museum was amazing! The number of artifacts and history stored there were truly mind boggling. The Egyptian ruins, artifacts from the Roman Empire, statues of the Greek Gods, etc. Definitely worth the entrance fee--which is FREE!</p><p>After viewing the museum, we had time for a quick English breakfast of eggs, grilled mushrooms, grilled tomatoes, baked beans (yes, baked beans), and white tea (which was delicious). We quickly ate our breakfast, headed back toward our hotel, picked up our souvenir--red bus tour Christmas ornament--checked out of our hotel, grabbed our bags, and hopped on the Tube to head back to Heathrow to catch our flight to Paris...</p>

											<h3>Tips for London</h3>
											<p>If you take the Tube, be sure to hold onto your ticket. You need the ticket to enter the station as well as to exit the station.</p>
											<p>Give yourself an additional hour more than typical to get through airport security--especially when travelling in the summer.​</p>

											<h3>Journal Highlights</h3>
											<h5>Sunday July 17, 2016</h5>
											<p>We landed in Paris a little early and proceeded to meet our driver who would take us directly to the hotel. (We also encountered three or four armed military men roaming the terminal--not a surprising sight to see after what happened in Nice just three days earlier.)</p><p>We got to our hotel safely, then set out for dinner...We had an incredible meal and made it through our first foreign language experience without much difficulty—and with the help of our trusty phrase book.</p><p>After dinner we headed back to our hotel to crash. It had been another long day.</p>
											<h5>Monday July 18, 2016</h5>
											<p>J and I then headed out for breakfast to enjoy a French pastry and coffee. The pan chocolate I had was phenomenal!</p><p> After walking for several hours, and logging numerous miles, it was time to head back to our hotel to meet our tour group.</p><p>Both J and I were a little nervous to meet our group. We weren't quite sure what to expect and just hoped that the majority of people would seem easy to get along with. Fortunately that was the case.</p><p>There are 24 of us in our group, including our group guide Miles, and quite a few families. There were four kids who just graduated high school, two who just graduated middle school, and one in elementary school. Crazy! </p><p>After meeting our group and having Miles get us acquainted with the subway system, we headed off to dinner.</p><p>We ended up at Royal Carbonne for dinner, as it was a little bit off the beaten path. We are so glad we did! The food was excellent and our server was outstanding! Best part of the evening, or at least most comical, was when a waitress (not our server) delivered Jason his beer. Jason took a sip of the beer. The waitress came back about a minute later and said, "Sorry, not your beer." She proceeded to pick up this beer and deliver it to the guy who originally ordered it! We were in complete shock, then died laughing because we know that would NOT go over in America... The best part? The other guy finished the beer off like it was nothing. Ha ha!</p>

The Eiffel Tower went back to its white lights our 											last night in the city.</p>
											<h3>Tips for Paris</h3>
											<p>* You will get a calf workout, and possible get dizzy, climbing all of the spiral staircases - our hotel had a tiny spiral staircase (along with an elevator) and the subway at Sacre Coeur had a large, very, very long, spiral staircase to get to the city level; needless to say our calves were feeling it by the end of our stay in Paris.<p>
											<p>* In Paris, if you plan on taking the subway multiple times, purchase the 10-ride pass. This will save you money if you plan on taking the subway more than six times. (Each ride needs one ticket--one ticket is needed each time you go down to the subway and come back up.</p>
											<p>* If you take the subway, hold onto your ticket until you come back up from the subway and are out of the metro station. The police will occasionally be checking tickets at the top of the stairs. If you can't present your ticket, you will be fined.</p>
											<p>* Though there is minimal tipping in France, the common/polite thing is to round up. So, if your bill is 56 euros, round up to 60. It is not possible to round up when paying with a credit card, so leave a couple of euros on the table in order to round up and provide that little extra tip.</p>

											<h5>Wednesday July 20, 2026</h5>
											<p>Today we made the easy drive to Beaune (prononuced Bone). Once in Beaune we were on our own to explore.</p><p>Our first stop, after walking through town, was at The Patriarche. The Patriarche, otherwise known as Caves Bourgogne, is a wine experience unlike any other. The place used to be a convent and has underground wine caves. The experience was amazing! And has subsequently (most likely) ruined future wine tasting experiences for me--which I am okay with!</p><p>The wine was excellent, but the atmosphere and experience was truly exceptional. Definitely a highlight! (Jason and I also picked up a couple of wine stopper souvenirs here--one for us and one for each of our moms).</p><p>The small town of Beaune is quite pretty inside the walls where the "old" city center is. We made our way around the town looking at the old hospital and Notre Dame chapel. We wandered in and out of shops and found a fantastic glass Beaune Christmas ornament, then met up with some tour mates (Rodney-CO, and Theresa-ME) for dinner. </p><p>We had dinner at La Galion where Jason had snails (actually delicious due to the butter sauce they were prepared in) and beef bourgonise. I also had the beef bourgoneese before we both had dessert. A nice meal and was fun getting to know some of the others on the tour. (In fact, the four of us were the only ones that did not have dinner with our guide Miles. Not that we didn't want to, but we figured the group would be large and with how small the restaurants are we knew it would not go over well with the restaurant. Glad we didn't go since you could tell Miles felt bad about how large the group got...)</p><p>After dinner we walked around and saw the Beaune illumination show. This illumination show lights up six different buildings throughout the town we picture stories of the history of France and Beaune. We ended up finding four out of the six illuminations, which were pretty incredible, before heading back to our hotel for bed.</p><p>All-in-all Beaune was a great stop. The wine tasting was definitely a highlight up to this point in the trip.</p>

											<p>* Wine tasting at The Patriache, a converted convent that has miles of tunnels and cellars filled with unbelievable amounts of wine.</p><p>* The illumination spectacular that happens nightly where they illuminate certain buildings throughout town that share the history of the region.</p>
											<h3>Tips for Beaune</h3>
											<p>One afternoon/evening is not nearly enough for this beautiful place. Would love to head back to see more of the sights and scenery! And wouldn't mind doing some more wine tasting as well...</p>

											<h6>(Switzerland was by far my favorite country, so get ready for a long journal entry!)</h6>
											<h5>Thursday July 21, 2016</h5>
											<p>This morning we loaded the bus to head to Switzerland. On our way to the Lauterbrunnen Valley, we made a stop in Bern, Switzerland. This town was fantastic! The architecture, the laid-back feel, the crystal clear water--gorgeous! We had such a fun time putzing around the town for a couple of hours. Next stop:  Lauterbrunnen!</p><p>The drive from Bern to Lauterbrunnen was absolutely gorgeous. I felt like I was back in Montana--near Glacier National Park--with all of the mountains, the lakes, waterfalls, etc. We pulled into Lauterbrunnen, walked around the town for a few minutes, then caught our train Wengen where we checked into the hotel Falkan. All I can say is, GORGEOUS!</p><p>That night we had dinner at the hotel, topped off by a massive Heineken on tap, followed by dessert. The food was delicious, and our rooms (though like stepping back in time) were lovely. I am already in love with this country and cannot wait to hike the Alps tomorrow.</p><p>(Today our tour member Sony (originally from Cuba but now she lives in Sonoma, CA) nicknamed us Jaylee.)</p>
											<img class="pics" src="images/switzerland/toast.jpg">
											<h5>Friday July, 22, 2016</h5>
											<p>We woke up to some clouds and drizzle this morning, but J and I were still determined to go hiking. We had breakfast at the hotel--mussli with fruit-yogurt, eggs, and birdman bread that was phenomenal--then mapped out our hiking route.</p>
											<p>J and Miles had talked the night before about hiking options. We decided to hike from Murren, up the Northface Trail, over to Sprutz to hike behind a waterfall (a definite highlight of the trip thus far!), then hike down to Gimmewald before catching the gondola down to the valley, the bus over to Lauterbrunnen, the train up to Wengen, the gondola up to Mannlichen, hiking over to Kleine Scheidegg, then hiking down to Wengen. Amazing experience, despite our legs screaming at us and getting caught in a rainstorm on our hike down.</p>
											<p>Once all cleaned up back at the hotel, we headed down to the lobby to mingle with our tour group. This is when we found out about what happened in Munich...</p>
											<p>Our original tour plan had us leaving for Munich the next day; however, there was a shooting in Munich today at one of their large shopping centers/malls. There reports of other incidents in the city and they weren't sure how many active shooters there were, so the city had basically been shut down and the police were encouraging people to shelter in their homes. All (most) of us were anxious waiting for Miles to give us the update on what our tour plans would be...</p>
											<p>Miles came into the lobby about 9:30pm and told us that we would proceed as though we were heading to Munich tomorrow, but he did inform us that those plans could very well change. So, we went to bed with the intent to head to Munich tomorrow.</p>											
										</div>
										<div class="col-md-4 sidebar">
											<h3>City Highlights</h3>
											<p>Hiking the Northface trail which took us behind a waterfall</p>
											<p>Lunch at the youth hostel in Gimmewald</p>
											<p>The view of the valley from the church in Wengen</p>
											<p>The Swiss Made Shop in Wengen</p>
											<h3>Tips for the Switzerland</h3>
											<p>Buy a rail pass/train pass if you plan on being in the valley for more than a day. Tickets in general are pricey, so if you are going to spend a couple of days there the pass will save you money.</p>
											<p>For one of the best views in the valley head to the steps in front of the church in Wengen--absolutely breathtaking viewpoint!</p>
											<p>For great Switzerland souvenirs head to the Swiss Made Shop in Wengen.</p>	
											<p>No tipping in Switzerland, as this is considered rude.</p>
											<p>Free bathrooms can be found at the train stations. (In Bern we used a bathroom at their grocery store and had to pay one franc a piece, despite making a purchase from the store.)</p>
											<p>Do not pre-purchase your tickets to the Schilthorn or Jungfrau, as these views are very dependent on weather. You don't want to spend that kind of coin if the weather is overcast or stormy.</p>
											<p>When you purchase items with a credit card in Switzerland it will ask if you want to purchase the item in US dollars or Swiss Francs, choose the Swiss Francs option. This will save you on the conversion rate, according to a local.</p>

											<h5>Sunday July 24, 2016</h5>
											<p>Today was supposed to be our bike day in Munich, but obviously plans changed. So, instead today we headed to Lake Lindau, Germany, stopped in Liechtenstein, then headed to Impst, Austria for our nights stay. </p><p>All-in-all we made six border crossings today:  Switzerland to Austria to Germany to Austria to Switzerland to Liechtenstein to Austria.</p><p>Lindau, Germany was beautiful. It is a small island that is surrounded by a lake that borders Austria, Germany, and Switzerland. Here we were able to eat and drink at an authentic German beer garden. I actually had the white sausage, which was much better than anticipated. Unfortunately they were out of their pretzels, but I still feel I had a true German experience all things considered.</p><p>We made a quick stop in Liechtenstein mostly so we could pay three euros to have our passports stamped. Was definitely worth the stop, though the country itself is quite expensive.</p><p>Finally we made our way to Impst, Austria for the night where we stayed at Hotel Arzlerhof. The hotel manager/owner Frans was quite friendly and definitely in control. The hotel was beautiful, with large but unique bathrooms (all glass enclosed with some etching to shadow out the body in the shower).  J and I walked around the hotel for just a few minutes, but then a thunderstorm, with lightning, rolled in over the mountains so we skirted back inside our hotel to wait for our group dinner--which was on Rick Steves Tours due to the change in our itinerary.</p>

											<h5>Monday July, 25, 2016</h5>
											<p>Breakfast this morning was outstanding! A huge spread with lots of great food at our hotel in Austria. A great way to start our day as we head to Venice.</p><p>On our way to Bolzono, Italy (our first stop of the day) we passed Innsbruck and saw the ski jump from the 1964 Winter Olympics as well as crossed over the tallest bridge in all of Europe.</p><p>Bolzano, Italy (otherwise known as Bozen to the Germans) was a much larger town than I was anticipating. Overall this was a nice, pleasant stop where we grabbed a suitcase (to carry our purchases home in), went to the grocery store to grab lunch, grabbed a pasty at a cafe so we could use their restroom, then grabbed some gelato before meeting up with our group. The town was a mix of German and Italian, had some beautiful mountains surrounding it, along with dirt cheap wine. Overall I would say my first Italian (mostly) experience was a good one. Next stop Venice!</p>

											<h5>Monday July 25, 2016</h5>
											<p>We arrived in Venice around 4pm. By the time we unloaded the bus, made a bathroom stop, and loaded our private boat over to the city, it was about 5pm before we checked into our hotel. J and I dropped our bags real quick and headed out to walk and explore the city.</p><p>Our first evening in Venice we saw the Bridge of Sighs (which is only accessible inside of Doge’s Palace), walked through St. Mark's Square, saw the outside of Doge's Palace and St. Mark's Basilica, walked over Realto Bridge (which had the sides under construction), saw the Academia, found the fish market, walked into numerous churches, and "got lost" per instruction to really see the city. We covered a lot of ground this evening, and shed a lot of sweat, and decided to find a small pub to eat dinner in. Fortunately there was one just down from our hotel, so we poked our heads in, saw a couple of people from our tour (Janice and her daughter Lila), so sat down to eat with them. J had the lasagna and I had the seafood risotto--both were outstanding! J also ordered the 1/2 liter of house red wine, which was delicious and dirt cheap (only 8 euros for about three glasses of wine), and I had a Spritz (prosecco wine and some sort of fizzy juice--okay, but J's wine was much better). Like I said, the food was outstanding, we had great company, and the overall price was very reasonable.</p>
											<h5>Tuesday, July 26, 2016</h5>
											<p>For our one full day in Venice we decided to get up early so that I could get a couple of pictures at/around sunrise. I had heard that this is one of the best times to be in Venice because the lighting is beautiful, and the cruise ship passengers have not yet embarked on the city. This was definitely the case as I was able to get some great shots.</p><p>After sunrise pictures, and breakfast, our first stop today was Doge's Palace. Doge's Palace is obscenely ornate, but totally worth the price of entry. The gold in the ceilings and along the staircases was just crazy! The ornate pictures, the marble that was everywhere, the different types of rooms--wow! I will say, despite how lovely the Palace rooms were, some of my favorite views within the Palace were from their windows to see the views looking out. Gorgeous views--and I took lots of pictures out of the windows.</p><p>Next we headed to St. Mark's Basilica to try to catch the lighting within the Basilica, which apparently only happens once a day. J dropped his bag at bag check, which then shot us to the front of the line. Most people were in line for a couple of hours, we didn't even wait a couple of minutes to get in! Inside the church we went, where no pictures are allowed. I tried to sneak a quick picture and was caught; meanwhile, hundreds of people around me continued to take pictures and videos. Oh well. Again, the pictures and architecture within the church were beautiful. We also heard a chamber choir singing (listed on one of our guide maps), which sounded beautiful.</p><p>After leaving the church we decided we had had enough of the crowds for the day, so we dropped J's bag in our room and then headed on a walk along the waterfront to check out the park at the very end of the island (look for the trees at the end of the island). Along our way we ran into a tour member, Sony (originally from Cuba), and invited her to walk with us. We found a fabulous park cafe with great views, sat down and had lunch. We split three different kinds of bruschetta (pronounced bru-ket-a in Italian), Sony had a beer, and J and I split the 1/2 liter of their house white wine. Both J and I had two glasses of wine out of this half liter and felt a little tipsy. We don't know if it was the heat, or if the wine had a little more kick to it, but we certainly did not need anything more to drink. Sony wasn't quite done though, she proceeded to order the five scoops of ice cream dessert option. J and I each had a couple bites with her, but then we were stuffed! Back to the room for a much needed siesta.</p><p>After our siesta we headed out to walk around the city a bit more before heading to dinner. We found the oldest pizzeria in Venice and ate there. After dinner—onto our gondola ride!</p><p>For the gondola ride our guide had arranged for us to group-up in order to cut down costs. Gondola rides after 7pm typically run around 130 euros for 30 minutes. Jason and I shared a gondola with the mother-daughter pairings on the tour:  Janice and Lila and Karen and Olivia. An evening gondola ride through Venice can be checked off the bucket list. (Thanks Grandma Hays!)</p>

											<p>Wander aimlessly and don’t be afraid to get lost. For starters, it is impossible not to get lost here at some point. Secondly, that is how you find some of the best local places.</p>
​											<p>It is considered illegal to purchase knockoff designer handbags here, so 											I wouldn’t recommend it.</p>
											<p>Spritz is the name of the early afternoon/early evening refreshing drink in Italy. It is prosecco wine with some sort of fruit juice (has a peach color tint to it); to dine like a local, try this.</p>
											<p>Limoncello is the name of the Italian after dinner drink. It is vodka and lemon juice/lemon peel that is condensed. It is quite potent and also refreshing. Another drink to try.</p>
											<p>The house wines in Italy are incredibly good and inexpensive. The 1/2 liter has approximately three glasses of wine in it for 7-8 euros. This is your best bang-for-your-buck.</p>

											<h5>Wednesday July 27, 2016</h5>
											<p>This morning we woke up, had breakfast, finished packing, caught our private boat back to our bus, and started the drive to Cinque Terre (pronounced chink-a-ter-a). J and I are really looking forward to some hiking and relaxing on the beach.</p><p>Monterosso means "Mountain of the Redheads" -- used to be ruled by a family of Celtic decent.</p><p>We arrived in Montorosso, after a long bus day and winding through the mountain pass and tight turns of Levanto, around 4:30pm. We checked into our hotel and briefly enjoyed our Mediterranean view before heading out to familiarize ourselves with the town.</p><p>We stayed in the "new town" of Monterosso, while most of the character and older restaurants are in "old town." We walked around for a bit, got cleaned up, picked up our hiking and train pass (which Miles had graciously picked up for us), and headed to dinner.</p><p>For dinner we walked to old town. We wandered around for a bit looking for a place to eat. We just happened upon a hole-in-the-wall place call St. Martino's that was dirt cheap and had some of the best lasagna we have ever had. I had the lasagna, J had the raviolli, and we split a bottle of wine. Total cost? Twenty euros! The owner kept apologizing that they only use plastic forks and knives, but promised us the food was homemade on a daily basis. It was outstanding!</p><p>On our way back to our hotel we ran into the Toronto family of Dave, Ingrid, Nadia (17), and Ronan (15). We talked to them for a bit as they finished their take out pizza on the cliff overlooking new town Monterosso. The view was fantastic and we had a nice conversation with them.</p><p>We then strolled back into town where we grabbed some gelato at a place across from our hotel entrance. Then it was up to bed as we had an early wake-up call for our hike tomorrow.</p>
											<h5>Thursday July, 28, 2016</h5>
											<p>We woke up this morning at 4:45am in order to be hiking the Cinque Terre trails by 5:15am. We ate our bananas, yogurt, and Swiss granola bars before heading out at 5:20am. It was still dark when we left the hotel, so I am glad we were running just a few minutes behind schedule.</p><p>We got to the trailhead around 5:30am and started our hike. It was still fairly dark and this trail to Vernazza has many steps and is uneven, so we would not recommend getting started too early in the day. You definitely need some light to see where you are going, as the trail is pretty narrow and not 100% safe if you can't see your next step. There were tons of steps, the surface was uneven, it was incredibly tight through spots, and our legs were already tired from all that we had done on previously; but, we continued on and were rewarded with some fantastic views.</p><p>We got to Vernazza in about an hour and half to two hours--right on schedule according to the Rick Steves guidebook. Vernazza is right on the water as well as Monterosso and had some great views. Even though their beach was small, it was much less crowded than Monterosso and seemed to have a more laid back vibe.</p><p>Next we took the trail from Vernazza to Corniglia. It took us another hour and a half to complete this trail. We did see some pretty great views on this trail as well and then got into Corniglia, which is the one town out of the five in Cinque Terre that is not directly on the water. We then took the 385 steps down to the train station to try to continue on the trail to Manarola. Unfortunately we came to a trail closed sign--you could literally see where the road had been washed out. This was a huge bummer, but we went back to the train station to catch the short train to Manarola.</p><p>We arrived in Manarola where J and I tried to hike to Riomaggiore, the last of the five towns. We got a short distance before seeing a trail closed sign due to a rock slid so we headed back into Manarola and found a small cafe with a water view to have breakfast.</p><p>After breakfast we took the train to Riomaggiore to purchase our boat tickets back to Monterosso. We purchased the one way tickets and enjoyed views of the region from the water.</p><p>Once we got back to our hotel, we changed into our swimsuits in hopes of renting a kayak for the rest of the day to kayak to a private beach somewhere. Unfortunately the price of the rentals ended up being much more than we were willing to pay, so we found a spot on the beach to lay out for a bit. (Note:  The beaches here, though beautiful views, are quite rocky. So don’t expect to be able to relax or lay out comfortably without a beach chair of some sort.)</p><p>We ended up napping away most of the afternoon and really didn't care. As the Rick Steves guidebook says, this is your place to relax and take it easy!</p><p>This evening the Rick Steves company hosted a happy hour for a group. Very nice to relax with the tour group and enjoy some appetizers and drinks on the tour.</p><p>After the group happy hour, J and I headed back to the same restaurant we went to the night before. The owner was very friendly and recommended we split the anchovies pasta dish, so we did. It was surprisingly good. We split the same bottle of wine that we had the previous night and had a lovely conversation with a Canadian woman who was travelling by herself. We had to cut our conversation with her short as we had agreed to go to dinner (a second dinner for us) with some of the tour group.</p><p>We met up with the tour group at Diablo--a pizzeria--where we each had a pizza and split another bottle of wine (red this time). We were stuffed by the end of it, but it was really fun to hang out with the group and have some good laughs. We then headed back to the hotel to head to bed because tomorrow is another fairly early wake-up call. Tomorrow onto Rome!</p>

											<h3>Tips for Cinque Terre</h3>
											<p>Do the math before purchasing all passes. We purchased the Cinque Terre card which gave us hiking and train access, but we did not use the train enough to justify the combo pass price.</p>
											<p>Be prepared for lots of tourists. This is no longer a hidden gem--and towns swell during the day when cruise ships dock in the area, so you will want to give yourself extra time to catch a train between towns if that is how you plan on getting about.</p>
											<p>Get off the beaten path while in the towns. This is how we found a phenomenal dinner option, and we had the opportunity to get to learn more about the culture.</p>
											<p>Take at least one boat ride while here. Views of the towns are most spectacular from the water.</p>

											<h5>Sunday July 29, 2016</h5>
											<p>(Note:  The Holy Door is open at St. Peter's, the door on the right hand side. Walking through this door cleanses your sins away. This door is open only four times in one hundred years.)</p><p>We arrived at our hotel in Rome a little after 4pm. We dropped our bags and went off to explore. We hit up an ATM real quick to grab our last little bit of cash (only our third ATM withdrawal--two of which we had to do in Paris) and were on our way. Our first stop was the Victor Emmanuel Monument. A beautiful building with some fantastic views, and also the home of the tomb of the unknown soldier where two guards stand by it day and night.</p><p>Next we walked around the Forum since we didn't have time to explore it this evening. We then headed off to the Colosseum before walking the Dolce Vita stroll (a Rick Steves guidebook recommendation). This walk took us to Trevi Fountain and the Spanish Steps.</p><p>After viewing all of these sites on foot, walking over 5 miles, we were beat. We decided to walk back to the hotel, freshen up, and then head out to dinner.</p><p>In trying to walk back to the hotel we got a little turned around when trying to cut through a subway station. It took us to a part of town I wasn't quite comfortable being in, so we turned around to walk back through the subway station in order to retrace our steps to our hotel. Of course, once we got back to our hotel and looked at a map, where we had ended up on the other side of the metro was about 100 yards from one of the most beautiful churches in Rome. Bummer! Oh well, off to dinner we went--a pizzeria close to our hotel that was listed in the guidebook, Pizzeria Ricci, Est est est.</p><p>After dinner we headed straight back to our hotel so that we would be ready for our early morning in order to get to the Vatican City in time for our morning appointment to see the Sistine Chapel.</p>
											<h5>Saturday July, 30, 2016</h5>
											<p>This morning we woke up early in order to get over to the Vatican City. Originally we had planned on walking to the Vatican, but decided to take the subway instead, which ended up being a great call.</p><p>We met up with our guide and group of about 20 and started walking around the Vatican Museum. There were tons of artifacts and artwork from various countries and the history behind a lot of it was fascinating to hear. J and I mentioned that it was interesting to hear the historical perspective from an Italian as it was very different from the stories we heard growing up. </p><p>The biggest issue with the Vatican Museum was how crowded it was. It was like herding cats, with no room to go anywhere except the direction of the masses. This is how we were entered into the Sistine Chapel as well. </p><p>The Sistine Chapel was pretty incredible to see; however, to be honest, it was not as magnificent as I had been expecting. (Note:  You are not allowed to take pictures inside the Sistine Chapel, so I will simply have to describe it.) The paintings were impressive and you could see the progression of Michael Angelo's work, but there was nothing ornate between the paintings to tie them together as you see in other beautiful cathedrals. The other part that was a bit of a letdown was again, the sheer number of people. You really didn't have the opportunity to look over all of the artwork to enjoy it or appreciate it. This is one of those things that we are glad we did to say that we've seen the Sistine Chapel, but it is not something we would pay money to see again.</p><p>Next we saw St. Peter's Basilica. Now this was impressive, massive, and ornate. It was pretty awesome to also see the balcony where the Pope says mass to the public.</p><p>After all of this, we headed back to our hotel (via the Metro) to grab some lunch from a grocery store and clean up a bit. We went to the grocery store across from our hotel and actually ended up buying milk and cereal. I guess you could say we were ready to start getting back to our normal. We then washed up in the hotel after lunch and then took the Metro again to see the Colosseum and Forum.</p><p>We did not pre-purchase tickets to the Colosseum and Forum (which come as a single pass), and our line actually seemed to move faster than pre-ppurchasedline. I'm not sure if this is always the case, but we felt good that we didn't have to stand in line too long.</p><p>Once we got into the Colosseum we pulled up the Rick Steves Colosseum walking guide tour. It had a lot of historical information that was fun to listen to. Overall it was so impressive walking around and seeing things that were so old. A definite highlight for us!</p><p>Next we headed to the Forum to walk around. Again we pulled up the Rick Steves walking tour and are glad we did. The Forum can be a bit confusing in terms of finding things, so it was helpful to follow the tour so we had a better understanding of what we were looking at. We also climbed up Palatial Hill before then returning to our hotel to shower (as it was another blazing hot day!) and take a nap before meeting our group for dinner.</p><p>Overall we had a productive day. We had mixed feelings on the Vatican tour but really enjoyed the Colosseum. Though we ended our sightseeing early, it was a good day and we had fun at dinner. Tomorrow we head back to the States! A great vacation, but we are ready to be home and can't wait to see Kaya!</p>
											<h5>Sunday July 31, 2016</h5>
											<p>This morning we woke up early, finished packing, ate breakfast, then caught a cab to the airport (we shared with mom and daughter duo Karen and Olivia). Miles told us we needed to experience Roman taxi drivers, and let's just say it was an experience. Nothing like going 95mph (150km)  and noticing that all posted signs are merely a recommendation. Wow. Scary! Just thankful we made it to the airport in one piece. The airport was another story, but fortunately we made our flight back to Toronto, found our car, then made the drive back to Michigan, all in time to get ready for work the next morning. All-in-all what a fantastic vacation!</p>

											<h3>City Highlights</h3>
											<p>The Vatican City</p>
​											<p>St. Peter's Basilica</p>											​
											<p>Sistine Chapel</p>
											<p>The Colosseum</p>
											<p>The Forum</p>
											<p>Trevi Fountain</p>
											<h3>Tips for Rome</h3>
											<p>In order to purchase subway tickets, you need cash--specifically small cash, as it only takes certain denominations and will return a bunch of coins upon purchase.</p>
											<p>Do the math if you are planning on using the subway. If you use the subway more than three times in a day, you will want the all-day pass.</p>
											<p>Wear light and airy clothes! Rome was brutally hot when we were there. Your clothes constantly stuck to you and the heat was intense!</p>
											<p>Always carry a water bottle with you. There are quite a few places to fill up your water bottle for free throughout the city.</p>
											<p>When headed to Rome, we would recommend booking tours through Walks of Italy. This group can get you passes to see the Sistine Chapel before it opens to the public and passes to see the Colosseum after it closes to the public. A mom and daughter in our group did this and said it was amazing. This is incredibly expensive, but worth it if you only have a short time in the city and want to see these places minus the masses of tourists. That being said, the Rick Steves app has a ton of great walking tour audios that can do just as nice of a job.</p>

								<h2>Travel Tips</h2>
								<div class="row">
									<div class="col-md-6 highlight">
										<h2>Teachable Moments</h2>
										<p>Monitor the exchange rate. When rates are favorable, pre-purchase currency from your local bank or credit union. This gives you locked-in rates and also cuts down on currency exchanges once in Europe.</p>
										<p>Always wear your money belt. It may not be the most comfortable thing, but it provides you peace of mind and also keeps your money safe!<p>Leave your passports in your room. You should not need them while out and about exploring.</p><p>Be prepared to pay to use restrooms in most all European countries. If a rest area gives you a ticket to use their bathroom, hold onto this ticket so that you may then get your money back if you purchase something in their store.</p><p>To save on electricity, hotel rooms require that you place your key card in the designated slot in order to turn on lights and the air conditioning. Helpful hint:  If you have a blank card of the same size, such as a business card, place this in the card holder when you leave your room so that the AC continues to run while you are out. Just don't blast it too much since AC is very expensive in Europe.</p><p>Make sure to turn in your room keys. Even key cards need to be turned in at most locations. If you have a large, non-key card, feel free to leave this at the front desk as you head out for the day. These keys typically come with a high price tag if lost, so by leaving it at the front desk you don't have to worry about losing it while out and about.​</p><p>Always take the time to do the math regarding travel passes. It does not always make sense to purchase the all day pass as opposed to single tickets.</p><p>If you get lost, don't panic. Take a deep breath and take the extra time to figure out where you're at before heading in a specific direction.</p>
									</div>

										<h2>Packing Tips</h2>
										<p><span class="tip">Pack light.</span>  Rick Steves recommends packing your bag at least a week in advance, then walking around your town to determine if it is feasible for you to be comfortable lugging your bag(s) around. Test, retest, and restest again. Believe us, you really don't need that extra t-shirt! (For tips on how to pack lightly, how to stay organized, and other packing tidbits, we utilized the Savvy Backpacker.)</p><p><span class="tip">Utilize packing cubes.</span> These cubes cut down on wasted space in your bag/suitcase and can help you pack the necessities without having to sit on your bag to create additional space.</p><p><span class="tip">Order is important.</span>  Place shoes at the bottom of your bag, then stack items appropriately on top with the smallest items ending up on the very top making for easier access.</p> <p>In general there is basic navigation to get from your tour bus to your hotel. The lighter you pack the easier it is to move about.</p><p>There are a lot of bridges in Venice that you have to take stairs up and down to cross. If you have a roller bag it can be difficult to move through the city. Try to pack everything into a smaller overnight bag and leave the rest of your gear on the bus.</p><p>Pack the minimum when it comes to toiletries. You can go to the grocery stores over there to pick up any additional items you may need. First off, there are grocery stores everywhere, so don't worry about not being able to find one. Secondly, shopping in local grocery stores is one of the best ways to learn about the local culture--and you might even find new products you love such as the sunscreen we found in Paris.</p>

									<div class="col-md-6 todo">
										<h2>Things to Do</h2>
										<p><span class="tip">Plan ahead</span>. This one can't be said enough. Even though it seems obvious, the more you plan ahead the less time you will waste once you're traveling. Unexpected things come up, but the more you are prepared the less these issues will stress you out.</p><p><span class="tip">Hit up grocery stores for lunches/snacks.</span>  By purchasing items here you are guaranteed to get something you like, and you also won't break the bank. </p><p><span class="tip">Find a local park to eat your lunch/snacks.</span>  This is another great way to get immersed in local culture--and the views are often incredible!</p><p><span class="tip">Purchase travel passes.</span>  If you're going to be someplace for more than two days, or if you plan on using public transportation frequently, it is much less expensive to buy the passes than it is to purchase individual tickets. Take advantage of this when you can.</p><p><span class="tip">Bring a USB multi-port charging dock.</span>  There are very few outlets in the hotel rooms. By bringing a muti-charging dock you can still charge all of your items from one outlet such as your phone, tablet, camera battery, etc.</p>
									</div>
									<div class="col-md-6 notdo">
									<h2>Things <span class="warning">Not</span> To Do</h2>
									<p>Do not try to save a few dollars if you can save a lot of time. E.g. pay more for a private taxi if it will get you somewhere twice as fast as the subway.</p><p>Do not stop in the middle of a street or sidewalk to figure out directions to wherever you are headed. Make sure to have your back against the side of a building as you try to read your map. This keeps your belongings safer since they are protected by the building.</p><p>Females do not make eye contact with men in Italy. This is considered an open invitation to them and can lead to harassment. This is one of many cultural differences. Nothing to be afraid of, you simply need to be educated on the differences. If harassment continues, or you get to the point where you are uncomfortable, simply say "Basta!" assertively--it rhymes with pasta--and they will stop.</p><p>Do not have your nose in a guidebook while traveling on public transportation. Nothing screams "tourist" or "I'm lost" such as this. Try to get your bearings before getting on your form of transit so that you know exactly where you are going and which stop you need.</p>
