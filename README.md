# A (Mostly) CSS and HTML Scrapbook

A good friend asked me to create a website where she could showcase her recent travels. Taking inspiration from the idea of a virtual scrapbook and after checking out several "how-to" tutorials, I was able to create this for her. CSS provides the animation for the page flips as well as the hovering effects on the images. It's still a work in progress, but a decent start. A demo should run without needing to install any additional resources other than the ones in the repo itself. Feel free to leave comments with suggestions or issues if you find any.
